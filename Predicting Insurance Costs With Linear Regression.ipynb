    "Of interest is how the different characteristics relate to the **total medical cost**, which is a continuous, positive number. The goal is to construct the best possible predictive model for the cost, given some information about the patient. Predicting medical costs is an important task as it allows hospitals to predict revenue and plan necessary procedures needed by its patient population."
